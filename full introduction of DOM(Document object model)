INTRODUCTION OF DOM(Document Object Model):::
where "Document" it is a file like "html and xml",
And "Object" it is like to be a "tags elements",
"Model" it is a "layout structure"....

Example for creating a normal files::::::::

<books>
  <book>
     <author>Carson</author>
     <price format="dollar">31.95</price>
     <pubdate>05/01/2001</pubdate>
  </book>
  <pubinfo>
     <publisher>MSPress</publisher>
     <state>WA</state>
  </publisher>
</books>

EXPLAINATION FOR THE ABOVE NORMAL FILES::
"<books>" is a root elements and [ "<book>" and "<pubinfo>"] this two are child elements for the root elements . 
"</book>" it is end of the particular files,"</publisher>" it is also a end of the particular files.
And finaally "</books> it is end of the overall files documents

DOM view(hide,refresh):::

I learn some example websites like :
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<        1]google.com
                                 2]opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com                    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
from the two websites i learn simple concept of the small changes of the document structures
** from the websites of    [opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com] i changes the login word into start ,this only today i learn it .

these are said to be a (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)
